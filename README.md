The first set of challenges is named "Bandit," and it's more of a tutorial to the Linux CLI, with each level's goal being to discover the password to move to the next.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. Don’t panic! Don’t give up! The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading a lot of new information.Before looking at the answers, I recommend doing it yourself because you won't learn anything unless you try. My primary idea is to demonstrate you how I handled it and to compare your solutions to mine.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Bandit Level 00

### Problem Description:
let's go :grinning: !!! Logging into the game using SSH.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162045944-4e5b543f-06e3-41c0-916b-5c6a17ac04ee.png)

### Solution & Explanation:
To begin, you must understand how to use the secure shell (SSH) protocol to connect to the bandit.labs.overthewire.org server. If you're using Linux, you may access the server by running the following command:


```
0xRh1d0Y@kali:~$ ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -l bandit0 -p 2220
```
If you're using Windows, though, you won't find an SSH client by default. While there are several great SSH clients available for use in Windows environments like PuTTY !  But , here i am using Termius it is straightforward and easy.

When you're finished entering the address ,port number,username and password then hit "hosts," and you'll be able to access the bandit0 shell.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Bandit Level 00 - 01

### Problem Description:

### Solution:

### Explanation:

This level is also a straightforward giveaway. As suggested by the level's hint, run **ls** to examine the current directory, then **cat** the **readme** file to view its information. 

If you don't understand the meaning behind any of these commands. Well, try to read the manual pages! **man** is the name of the command that pulls up manpages. So you use **man** by doing this:

```
$ man [name of program you are interested in]
```
Here is the manpages of **ls** and **cat**:

### Summary:
```
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
 ```
The password to the level 01's box is **boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1**


## :triangular_flag_on_post: Bandit Level 01 - 02

### Problem Description:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162151146-748f84ef-9b59-407c-8267-85eb1ace4d77.png)

### Solution:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162151326-8b3a6462-658a-474f-a0c0-ff0b8a67ad72.png)

### Explanation:
To acquire the password for stage 2, we have to print the content of the file called **–** (the dash symbol), as recommended by the hint.

If you just use the **cat** command to read and print the contents of the file called **–**, unfortunately, your terminal will become stuck. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162151886-49824c11-8c76-43d3-ae28-19f195543935.png)

As we can see, `cat` command doesn't work with a dashed filename
Instead, so as to hide the special character from `cat`, we direct the `cat` command to the file location.You must supply the full path of the file.

### Summary:
```
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```
The password to gain access to the level 02's box is **CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9**



## :triangular_flag_on_post: Bandit Level 02 - 03

### Problem Description:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162153896-a5e80005-0ad9-4736-a5b8-5faea4d23fbf.png)

### Solution:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79222856/162154105-cf0f07e2-d675-4ec4-b556-53332d406708.png)

### Explanation:
Accessing a file with spaces in its name:
To read a file name with spaces, use quotes (' ')
Either use a backslash before each space or write the full file name as a string. As an example: 
1. Adding backslash before each space:    
```
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```
2. Adding double quote:
```
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
```
Another command that is really useful for this round is **tab completion**, which is triggered by pressing **tab**. This would make the program automatically fills in partially typed commands. 

### Summary:
```
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls 
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```
The password to gain access to the level 03's box is **UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK**
